## Public address

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

All Teleport services (e.g., the Proxy Service, Auth Service, and Nodes) have an
optional `public_addr` property that you can modify in each service's
configuration file. The public address can take an IP or a DNS name. It can also
be a list of values:

```yaml
public_addr: ["proxy-one.example.com", "proxy-two.example.com"]
```

Specifying a public address for a Teleport service may be useful in the
following use cases:

- You have multiple identical services, e.g., Proxy Service instances, behind a
  load balancer.
- You want Teleport to issue an SSH certificate for the service with additional
  principals, e.g., host names.

## HTTP CONNECT proxies

Some networks funnel all connections through a proxy server where they can be
audited and access control rules can be applied. For these scenarios, Teleport
supports HTTP CONNECT tunneling.

To use HTTP CONNECT tunneling, set the `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`
environment variables when running Teleport. You can also optionally set the
`NO_PROXY` environment variable to avoid use of the proxy when accessing
specified hosts/netmasks.

For example, when launching Teleport with `systemd`, you can add
the following lines to your `systemd` unit file, replacing `proxy.example.com` with
the address of your proxy.

```
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8"
```

When Teleport builds and establishes the reverse tunnel to the main cluster, it will funnel all traffic through the proxy. Specifically, if using the default configuration, Teleport will tunnel ports `3024` (SSH, reverse tunnel) and `3080` (HTTPS, establishing trust) through the proxy.

The value of `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY` should be in the format
`scheme://host:port` where scheme is either `https` or `http` . If the value is
`host:port` , Teleport will prepend `http` .

<Admonition

  `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are invalid values for the proxy host. If for some reason your proxy runs locally, you'll need to provide some other DNS name or a private IP address for it.

## Ports

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

Teleport services listen on several ports. This table shows the default port
numbers for each service.

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Note"
>

  To get a listing of the assigned ports for an instance of the Teleport Proxy
  Service, use the following command:

  ```code
  $ curl https://teleport.example.com:443/webapi/ping | jq 
  ```

  Note that if `auth_service.proxy_listener_mode` is set to `multiplex` in your
  Teleport configuration, that means only a single port is used for
  multiple services through the Proxy.

| Port | Service | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 3022 | Node | SSH port. This is Teleport's equivalent of port `#22` for SSH. |
| 3023 | Proxy | SSH port clients connect to. The Proxy Service will forward this connection to port `#3022` on the destination Node. |
| 3024 | Proxy | SSH port used to create "reverse SSH tunnels" from behind-firewall environments into a trusted proxy server. |
| 3025 | Auth | SSH port used by the Auth Service to serve its API to other Nodes in a cluster. |
| 3080 | Proxy | HTTPS connection to authenticate `tsh` users into the cluster. The same connection is used to serve a Web UI. |
| 3026 | Kubernetes | HTTPS Kubernetes proxy `proxy_service.kube_listen_addr` |
| 3027 | Kubernetes | Kubernetes Service `kubernetes_service.listen_addr` |
| 3028 | Desktop | Desktop Service `windows_desktop_service.listen_addr` |
| 3036 | MySQL | MySQL port `proxy_service.mysql_addr` |
</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Cloud">

Teleport Cloud allocates a different set of ports to each tenant. To see which
ports are available for your Teleport Cloud tenant, run a command similar to the
following, replacing `mytenant.teleport.sh` with your tenant domain:

```code
$ curl https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.proxy'
```

The output should resemble the following, including the unique ports assigned to
your tenant:

```json
{
  "kube": {
    "enabled": true,
    "public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11107",
    "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3026"
  },
  "ssh": {
    "listen_addr": "[::]:3023",
    "tunnel_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3024",
    "public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:443",
    "ssh_public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11105",
    "ssh_tunnel_public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11106"
  },
  "db": {
    "postgres_public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11109",
    "mysql_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3036",
    "mysql_public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11108"
  },
  "tls_routing_enabled": true
}
```

This output also indicates whether TLS routing is enabled for your tenant. When
TLS routing is enabled, connections to a Teleport service (e.g., the Teleport
SSH Service) are routed through the Proxy Service's public web address, rather
than through a port allocated to that service.

In this case, you can see that TLS routing is enabled, and that the Proxy
Service's public web address (`ssh.public_addr`) is `mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.
