## Community FAQ

### Can I use Teleport in production today?

Teleport has been deployed on server clusters with thousands of nodes at
Fortune 500 companies. It has been through several security audits from
nationally recognized technology security companies, so we are comfortable with
the stability of Teleport from a security perspective.

### Can Teleport be deployed in agentless mode?

Yes. Teleport can be deployed with a tiny footprint as an authentication
gateway/proxy and you can keep your existing SSH servers on the nodes. But some
innovating Teleport features, such as cluster introspection, will not be
available unless the Teleport SSH daemon is present on all cluster nodes.

### Can I use OpenSSH with a Teleport cluster?

Yes, this question comes up often and is related to the previous one. Take a
look at [Using OpenSSH Guide](./server-access/guides/openssh.mdx).

### Can I connect to nodes behind a firewall?

Yes, Teleport supports reverse SSH tunnels out of the box. To configure
behind-firewall clusters refer to [Trusted Clusters](./setup/admin/trustedclusters.mdx)
section of the Admin Manual.

### Can individual nodes create reverse tunnels to a proxy server without creating a new cluster?

This was a popular customer
[request](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/803) that was added
in Teleport version 4.0. Change the node config option `--auth-server` flag when
running the `teleport` daemon on an agent to point to the Proxy Service address
(this would be `public_addr` and `web_listen_addr` in file configuration). For
more information, see
[Adding Nodes to the Cluster](./setup/admin/adding-nodes.mdx).

### Can nodes use a single port for reverse tunnels?

Yes, Teleport supports tunnel multiplexing on a single port. Set the
`tunnel_listen_addr` to use the same port as the `web_listen_addr` address
setting in the `proxy_service` configuration. Teleport will automatically use
multiplexing with that configuration.

## How is Open Source different from Enterprise?

Open Source Teleport is licensed under the Apache 2 License, and must be
self-hosted. Enterprise Teleport is commercially licensed and is available in
both self-hosted and cloud deployments.

**How should I upgrade my cluster?**

Please follow our guidelines for [upgrading](./setup/admin/graceful-restarts.mdx).
We recommend that the Auth Server should be upgraded first, and the proxy bumped thereafter.

### Does Web UI support copy and paste?

Yes. You can copy and paste using a mouse. If you prefer a keyboard, Teleport employs
`tmux`-like "prefix" mode. To enter prefix mode, use the `Ctrl`+`A` keyboard shortcut.

While in prefix mode, you can press `Ctrl`+`V` to paste, or enter text selection
mode by pressing `[`. When in text selection mode:

- Move around using the keys `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l`.
- Select text by toggling `space`.
- And, copy it via `Ctrl`+`C`.

### What TCP ports does Teleport use?

Please refer to the [Ports](./setup/reference/networking.mdx) section of the Admin Manual.

### Does Teleport support authentication via OAuth, SAML, or Active Directory?

Gravitational offers this feature for the [Enterprise versions of Teleport](enterprise/introduction.mdx).

### Does Teleport send any data back to the cloud?

The Open-Source Edition of Teleport does not send any information to
Gravitational and can be used on servers without internet access. The
commercial versions of Teleport may or may not be configured to send anonymized information to Gravitational, depending on the license purchased. This information contains the following:

- Anonymized user ID: SHA256 hash of a username with a randomly generated prefix.
- Anonymized server ID: SHA256 hash of a server IP with a randomly generated prefix.

This allows Teleport to print a warning if users are exceeding the usage limits
of their license. The reporting library code is
[on GitHub](https://github.com/gravitational/reporting).

Reach out to `sales@goteleport.com` if you have questions about the commercial
edition of Teleport.
