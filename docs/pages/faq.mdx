## Can I use Teleport in production today?

Teleport has been deployed on server clusters with thousands of hosts at
Fortune 500 companies. It has been through several security audits from
nationally recognized technology security companies, so we are comfortable with
the stability of Teleport from a security perspective.

## Can Teleport be deployed in agentless mode?

Yes. Teleport can be deployed with a tiny footprint as an authentication
gateway/proxy and you can keep your existing SSH servers on Teleport Nodes. But
some innovating Teleport features, such as cluster introspection, will not be
available unless the Teleport SSH daemon is present on all cluster Nodes.

## Can I use OpenSSH with a Teleport cluster?

Yes, this question comes up often and is related to the previous one. Take a
look at [Using OpenSSH Guide](./server-access/guides/openssh.mdx).

## Can I connect to Nodes behind a firewall?

Yes, Teleport supports reverse SSH tunnels out of the box. To configure
behind-firewall clusters refer to our
[Trusted Clusters](./setup/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) guide.

## Can individual agents create reverse tunnels to the Proxy Service without creating a new cluster?

Yes. When running a Teleport agent, use the `--auth-server` flag to point to the
Proxy Service address (this would be `public_addr` and `web_listen_addr` in your
file configuration). For more information, see
[Adding Nodes to the Cluster](./setup/admin/adding-nodes.mdx).

## Can Nodes use a single port for reverse tunnels?

Yes, Teleport supports tunnel multiplexing on a single port. Set the
`tunnel_listen_addr` to use the same port as the `web_listen_addr` address
setting in the `proxy_service` configuration. Teleport will automatically use
multiplexing with that configuration.

## How is Open Source different from Enterprise?

Teleport provides three offerings:

- Open Source
- Enterprise
- Cloud

## Which version of Teleport is supported?

Teleport provides security-critical support for the current and two previous releases. With our typical release cadence, this means a release is usually supported for 9 months.

See our [Upgrading](./setup/operations/upgrading.mdx) guide for more
information.

## Does the Web UI support copy and paste?

Yes. You can copy and paste using a mouse. If you prefer a keyboard, Teleport employs
`tmux`-like "prefix" mode. To enter prefix mode, use the `Ctrl`+`A` keyboard shortcut.

While in prefix mode, you can press `Ctrl`+`V` to paste, or enter text selection
mode by pressing `[`. When in text selection mode:

- Move around using the keys `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l`.
- Select text by toggling `space`.
- And, copy it via `Ctrl`+`C`.

## What TCP ports does Teleport use?

Please refer to our [Networking](./setup/reference/networking.mdx) guide.

## Does Teleport support authentication via OAuth, SAML, or Active Directory?

Teleport offers this feature for the [Enterprise versions of Teleport](enterprise/introduction.mdx).

## Does Teleport send any data back to the cloud?

The open source and Enterprise editions of Teleport do not send any information
to our company, and can be used on servers without internet access. 

The commercial editions of Teleport can optionally be configured to send
anonymized information, depending on the license purchased. This information
contains the following:

- Anonymized user ID: SHA256 hash of a username with a randomly generated prefix.
- Anonymized server ID: SHA256 hash of a server IP with a randomly generated prefix.

This allows Teleport Cloud and Teleport Enterprise to print a warning if users
are exceeding the usage limits of their license. The reporting library code is
[on GitHub](https://github.com/gravitational/reporting).

Reach out to `sales@goteleport.com` if you have questions about the commercial
editions of Teleport.
