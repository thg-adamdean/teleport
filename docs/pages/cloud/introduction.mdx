Teleport Cloud is a managed service to provide access to secure infrastructure
all over the world without passwords or shared secrets.

When you [sign up for a Teleport Cloud account](https://goteleport.com/signup/), you will receive a subdomain of
`teleport.sh` that is dedicated to your tenant and points to the Teleport Proxy
Service. 

Our Teleport Cloud team handles the following tasks for you:

- Auth and Proxy Service upgrades, security patches, scaling, monitoring,
  maintenance, and network configuration
- Auth Service backend management
- Backup and restore of cluster data
- Storage of audit logs and session recordings
- DNS record management

A Teleport Cloud account takes minutes to set up. After that, you can define
roles, register SSO providers, and start connecting all of your infrastructure,
including servers, databases, Kubernetes clusters, applications, Windows
desktops, and service accounts.
