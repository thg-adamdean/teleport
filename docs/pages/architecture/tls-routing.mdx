  TLS routing is available starting from Teleport `8.0`.
</Details>

In TLS routing mode [Teleport proxy](./proxy.mdx) multiplexes all client
connections on a single TLS port.

With TLS routing, cluster administrators can simplify network configurations
since proxy only listens on one port. All connections are authenticated with
mutual TLS and users are able to tunnel protocols that may be blocked on the
network such as SSH.

To implement TLS routing, Teleport uses SNI ([Server Name Indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication))
and ALPN ([Application-Level Protocol Negotiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation))
TLS extensions.

## How it works

Starting from version `8.0` Teleport proxy listens for all client connections
on its `web_listen_addr` by default:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  web_listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:443"
```

All Teleport clients including SSH, web browser, kubectl, database and reverse
tunnel clients establish a TLS tunnel to the proxy's web port and indicate the
protocol they're requesting using SNI and ALPN TLS extensions.

Upon accepting a new connection, the proxy inspects the SNI/ALPN value in the
TLS handshake and forwards the connection to appropriate backend service.

### Local proxy

Clients like `psql` or `mysql` implement TLS handshake as a part of their
protocol-specific connection negotiation phase (aka [STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS)).

To support these clients, as well as clients that do support TLS but don't allow
setting custom ALPN values, Teleport's `tsh` client includes ability to start
a local TLS routing aware proxy.

Such clients connect to the local proxy instead of Teleport proxy directly. The
local proxy establishes a TLS connection to the Teleport proxy with the proper
SNI/ALPN values set and tunnels the client's connection over it.

In most cases, clients handle TLS routing transparently when establishing
connection. For example, `tsh` client starts local proxy and sets appropriate
SNI/ALPN values automatically. For some clients, like native/GUI database
clients instead of `tsh db connect`, the user needs to start the local proxy so
these clients can connect to it.

Let's take a look at how each protocol Teleport supports implements TLS routing.

## SSH

Teleport client `tsh`, when connecting to an SSH node, first dials Teleport
proxy over TLS and requests `teleport-ssh-proxy` ALPN protocol.

No local proxy is started in this case as `tsh` uses this TLS connection as a
transport to establish the SSH connection.

### OpenSSH

To support standard OpenSSH client, Teleport provides a `tsh proxy ssh` command
which can be used as a `ProxyCommand`.

Similarly to `tsh ssh`, `tsh proxy ssh` establishes a TLS tunnel to Teleport
proxy with `teleport-ssh-proxy` ALPN protocol, which `ssh` then connects over.

See the [OpenSSH client](../server-access/guides/openssh.mdx) guide for details on
how it's configured.

## Reverse tunnels

Reverse tunnel agents for Teleport node, application and database services, as
well as for trusted clusters, open a TLS tunnel to the cluster's proxy with
`teleport-reversetunnel` ALPN protocol and then dials SSH over it establishing
the reverse tunnel connection.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes client `kubectl` uses HTTPS API and TLS handshake to talk to the API
server.

As such, it is not possible to request a custom ALPN protocol using `kubectl`.
Instead, Teleport leverages SNI and sets a `ServerName` prefixed with `kube.`
when generating a kubeconfig file during `tsh kube login`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: ...
    server: https://proxy.example.com:443
    tls-server-name: kube.proxy.example.com
  name: example
```

## Databases

The `tsh db connect` command executes an appropriate database client for the
database you're connecting to.

In TLS routing mode, `tsh` starts a local proxy which database client connection
is tunneled through. The local proxy uses one of `teleport-postgres`,
`teleport-mysql` or `teleport-mongodb` ALPN values depending on the database.
The proxy is shut down when the database session ends.

### Native and GUI clients

For the native or graphical database clients to work with TLS routing, they
must be connecting to the local proxy instead of Teleport proxy directly.

Teleport provides a `tsh proxy db` command to launch a local database proxy:

```code
$ tsh proxy db example-db
```

See [GUI clients](../database-access/guides/gui-clients.mdx) guide for a usage
example.

## Web UI, apps and desktops

Application access, desktop access and Teleport web UI are served by the
Teleport proxy's web listener and don't require a local proxy or any special
ALPN/SNI negotiation. These web connections use standard `http1.1` and `h2`
protocols for ALPN.
